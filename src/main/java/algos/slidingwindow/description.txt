What ?
------------------
1.Fixed Window:
In a fixed window problem, we have a predefined window size that remains constant throughout
the problem-solving process.

2. variable window
In a variable window problem,the window size is not fixed and can change dynamically based
on certain conditions or criteria. The template for solving a variable window problem involves maintaining
two pointers, start and end, which represent the indices of the current window.


Problems based on this
